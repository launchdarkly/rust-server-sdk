## [1.1.3] - 2023-08-10
### Fixed:
- Fixed an issue with evaluating user targets as part of a multi-kind context.

## [1.1.2] - 2023-06-26
### Removed:
- Removed reliance on `built` crate.

## [1.1.1] - 2023-05-10
### Fixed:
- The secure mode hashing algorithm has been updated to use the context's fully qualified key.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-05-03
### Changed:
- Updated MSRV from 1.60.0 to 1.64.0

### Fixed:
- Ensure an error is logged if a persistence store fails to initialize appropriately.
- Resolve issue with parsing partially read polling response bodies.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-12-07
The latest version of this SDK supports LaunchDarkly's new custom contexts feature. Contexts are an evolution of a previously-existing concept, "users." Contexts let you create targeting rules for feature flags based on a variety of different information, including attributes pertaining to users, organizations, devices, and more. You can even combine contexts to create "multi-contexts." 

For detailed information about this version, please refer to the list below. For information on how to upgrade from the previous version, please read the [migration guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/rust/implementation-v1).
